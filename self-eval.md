# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

# The challenges were tough even thougI'e done them before. this time around I relied more on mylself than any of my cohort mates.
